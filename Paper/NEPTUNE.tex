\documentclass[twoside, fontset=aaronfonts, design]{mitthesis}% fontset=newtx, fontset=libertine, fontset=libertinus, fontset=lmodern, fontset=newtx-sans-text, fontset=fira-newtxsf, fontset=heros-stix2, fontset=stix2, fontset=lmodern
%
% option [twoside]		gives facing-page behavior for printing; omitting twoside will eliminate even-numbered blank pages.
% option [lineno]	 	provides line numbers, as for editing
% option [mydesign] 	loads packages for color, title and list formats, margins, or captions: edit design.tex to change defaults.
% option [fontset] is a keyvalue which can be:
%					 	for pdftex or unicode engines:  defaultfonts, libertine, libertinus, lmodern, lucida
%					 	for pdftex only: 				fira-newtxsf, newtx, newtx-sans-text
%						for unicode engines (luatex):	heros-stix2, stix2, termes, termes-stix2
%					 	if no key value is given, fonts default to CMR (pdftex) or LMR (unicode), i.e., "the LaTeX font".
%					 	You can edit the fontset files or you can write your own, myfonts.tex, and do [fontset=myfonts].
%						If you are using multiple languages, load the babel package in your fontset file, before the fonts.

\usepackage{lipsum}
\IfPackageAtLeastTF{lipsum}{2021/09/20}{\setlipsum{auto-lang=false}}{}
%% Table related packages  
\usepackage{booktabs}% publication quality tables (https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs)
\usepackage{array}% Additional options for column formats (https://ctan.org/pkg/array)
\usepackage{dcolumn}% For alignment of numbers on the decimal place (https://ctan.org/pkg/dcolumn) 
  \newcolumntype{d}[1]{D{.}{.}{#1}}% use with dcolumn package. Note: dcolumns are set in math mode.
  % syntax: d{x.y} where x is max number of digits before decimal and y is max number after.
% Package for multipage table in Appendix B.

%%%%%%%%%  Graphics path (to figure files)  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Can set graphicspath to point to specific directories containing figures (the current directory is searched automatically)
%% For instance, to search a subdirectory of the current directory called "figures" and a parallel directory called "art", set:
\graphicspath{ {resources}}
% \graphicspath{ {figures/} {../art/} }% For details see: https://latexref.xyz/dev/latex2e.html#g_t_005cgraphicspath

%%%%%%%%%  Representative set-up for biblatex  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Numerical citations of references
\usepackage[style=ext-numeric-comp,giveninits=true,maxbibnames=10,sorting=none]{biblatex}

%% IEEE style citations and references
% \usepackage[style=ieee,maxbibnames=10,sorting=none]{biblatex}% style=ext-numeric-comp,articlein=false,giveninits=true
%	 \DefineBibliographyStrings{english}{url= \textsc{url} ,  }% replaces the IEEE default "[Online]. Available" by "URL"

%% author-year style citations and references 
%% use \parencite, not \cite, when you want "(Author, year)"
%% The sample files are not set up to include parentheses.
% \usepackage[style=authoryear, maxbibnames=10]{biblatex} 


\addbibresource{neptune-bibliography.bib}

%% to avoid split urls and stretched white space, you can set the bibliography ragged-right:
%\appto{\bibsetup}{\raggedright}

%% biblatex is very powerful, and you can customize most aspects the reference list and citations to suit your needs.
%%   documentation is here: https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex
%%   cheat sheet is here:   https://tug.ctan.org/info/biblatex-cheatsheet/biblatex-cheatsheet.pdf

%% To ensure citations are set, run Latex --> biblatex/biber --> Latex again

% See Table 1.1 in Chapter 1

\DeclareMathOperator{\Erf}{erf}
\DeclareMathOperator{\Erfc}{erfc}
\DeclarePairedDelimiterXPP\erf[1]{\Erf\mkern1mu}(){}{#1}% increase to 2mu with stix2 font
\DeclarePairedDelimiterXPP\erfc[1]{\Erfc\mkern1mu}(){}{#1}
